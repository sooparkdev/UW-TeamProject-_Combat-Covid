# Project Brainstorm

## Domain of Interest
We are interested in health-related data sets because of the current pandemic that is going on. We want to learn more about health behaviors and outcomes in different areas of the country and see the different health trends that may appear. More specifically, we are interested in learning about accessibility to healthcare.


## Examples of Data-driven Projects
- [Local Burden of Disease Project](http://www.healthdata.org/lbd/about) by IHME uses geo-located data to generate a map of the continent of Africa to provide easy visualization of the health trends and outcomes across different nations within.

- Worldometer aggregates data from thousands of sources, such as government institutions or press briefing’s live streams, and provides [live statistics of COVID-19](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) of countries all over the world. The analysts validate the data before it gets updated on the website.  

- IHME’s [COVID-19 projections model](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) indicates deaths per day, total deaths, and use of hospital resources in line graphs for different countries. This project is notable in that it produces predictions in the coming days and weeks.


## Questions We are Interested in Answering
- How is income linked to access to healthcare?
- How does geographical location affect access to healthcare?
- What demographic of people are the most denied to healthcare?
- What groups of people are more at risk of certain diseases?
- What determinants of health are most responsible for health care visits?

We can look at data sets that may include information about these questions and analyze the data by looking through the different columns and rows to see how they relate to each other.


## Datasets Found

[**First Source**](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/health-care-access-coverage#access.csv)

- This data was downloaded through Kaggle by searching up “health care accessibility data sets” on Google.

- The data was collected by the CDC, who sends out a survey annually. It gathers data on each state about the percentage of people who have health care coverage. More specifically, the data was provided by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

- There are 1640 rows and 7 columns, which include a year, state, yes, no, category, condition, and location, in the data.

- This data answers the question of "how geographical location affects accessibility to healthcare?"


[**Second Source**](https://dashboard.healthit.gov/datadashboard/documentation/hospital-public-health-reporting-documentation.php)

- This data was downloaded through HealthIT.gov.

- The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and it was created by the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. The data was collected by attesting various hospitals that participated in the EHR Incentive Program.

- The data has 156 rows and 10 columns.

- This data answers the question of "how does geographical location affect access to healthcare?"


[**Third Source**](https://www.kaggle.com/hhs/health-insurance)
- This data was downloaded through Kaggle like the first and second sources aforementioned.

- The data was generated from the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Census Bureau. The data was created to see the effects of the Affordable care act. Thus, it compares the data from 2010 and 2015 to show the effects of health insurance rates by state.

- There are 52 rows and 14 columns in the data.

- This data answers the question of "how geographical location affects accessibility" and "what specific demographic of people are the most denied to healthcare?"
